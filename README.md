# PHP CRUD Project

The PHP CRUD project is a web application that demonstrates the basic functionalities of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a simple dataset. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the data, perform CRUD operations, and see the changes in real-time.

## Features

- **Create**: Users can add new records to the database by filling out a form with relevant information. The application validates the input and ensures that all required fields are filled before saving the new record.

- **Read**: The application allows users to view the existing records in a tabular format. Users can easily search, filter, and sort the data to find specific records quickly.

- **Update**: Users can edit the existing records to update their information. The application provides an edit form pre-populated with the current data, making it easy for users to make changes and save the updates.

- **Delete**: Users have the option to remove unwanted records from the database. Before performing the deletion, the application asks for confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The core programming language used to develop the application logic and handle server-side operations.

- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage the application's data.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Used for creating the user interface, styling the web pages, and adding interactive elements for a better user experience.

- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework that ensures the application's responsive design and consistency across different devices.

## Purpose

The PHP CRUD project serves as an educational and practical example for web developers to understand how to implement basic CRUD functionalities in PHP and MySQL. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications that require data manipulation capabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the PHP CRUD project locally, you need a web server (like Apache) with PHP and MySQL installed. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Import the provided database into your MySQL server.

3. Configure the database connection settings in the application.

4. Access the application through your web browser, and you can start experimenting with the CRUD functionalities.

**Test Account:** To test the application, you can use the following test email and password:

- **Email:** test@gmail.com
- **Password:** test@123

Please note that this project is for learning purposes and may not include advanced security measures. When deploying similar applications in a production environment, additional security considerations should be taken into account to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

Feel free to contribute to the project, provide feedback, or use it as a reference to build your own PHP CRUD applications! Happy coding!
